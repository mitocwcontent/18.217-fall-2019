**Description:** Professor Zhao discusses in this lecture the dependent random choice method in probabilistic combinatorics and its application to upper bounding the number of edges in an H-free graph, where H is a sparse bipartite graph. Also discussed in this lecture are the problems of forbidding an even cycle, and forbidding a clique 1-subdivision.

(The video is unfortunately cut off near the end due to technical issues with the recording. Students can refer to the notes for details.)

**Instructor:** Yufei Zhao
